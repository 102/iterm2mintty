# Iterm2mintty

Still very very very much a work in progress. Converts existing iterm2 colorscheme into a mintty
compatible one.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'iterm2mintty'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install iterm2mintty

## Usage

```
iterm2mintty somecolorscheme.itermcolors
```

Should output a .minttyrc file in whatever directory you ran it in.
